              The reason for having such convention in place is that when the name of the java source file is same as the name of the class that contains the main() method, then the user need not remember the name of the source file and the class name separately.<br>

          <p>
              Yes, given that the type or count of params are different. Note that return type in this case does not play any role which means that if you define main() method simply changing the return type it flags an error. This is because JVM issues call to main() method as Classname.main(<params fetched from command line as strings>) and therefore JVM won't be able to differentiate between main() methods having different return types. This error gets flagged at compile time itself.<br>

          <p>The main() method is always public.

          <p>The main() method is called by JVM when the Java Application Launcher is invoked. JVM does not instantiate the class in which the main() method is defined to access the main() method.

          <p>
              Comments are the statements which the programmer adds to the code to explain what the code is doing. <br>
              <br>
              The characterisitic property of comments is that, they are simply ignored by the compiler. <br>
              <br>
              In java, there are 3 types of comments:-<br>
              <br>
              1. <b>Single line comments</b>:- They begin with two forward slashes and end with the line. They are used to comment only one line.<br><br>
              2. <b>Multi line comments</b>:- They begin with a forward slash and a asterisk, extend over multiple lines and end with a asterisk and a forward slash. They are used to comment multiple lines together. Note:- Multi line comments can also be used in a single line but using like that does not make sense when single line comments are already there for the purpose.<br><br>
              3. <b>Documentation comments</b>:- They begin with a forward slash and two asterisk symbols, stretch over multiple lines and end with an asterisk symbol and a forward slash. They are used to generate method documentation.<br><br>
